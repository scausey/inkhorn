  <h1>Currently Reading: Rebel of the Sands (Rebel of the Sands #1), by Alwyn Hamilton</h1>
  <h4>Started December 1, 2017</h4>
  <div class="current-book-content">
    <div class="blurb">
      <p>Mortals rule the desert nation of Miraji, but mythical beasts still roam the wild and remote areas, and rumor has it that somewhere, djinn still perform their magic.  For humans, it’s an unforgiving place, especially if you’re poor, orphaned, or female.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Amani Al’Hiza is all three.  She’s a gifted gunslinger with perfect aim, but she can’t shoot her way out of Dustwalk, the back-country town where she’s destined to wind up wed or dead.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Then she meets Jin, a rakish foreigner, in a shooting contest, and sees him as the perfect escape route. But though she’s spent years dreaming of leaving Dustwalk, she never imagined she’d gallop away on mythical horse—or that it would take a foreign fugitive to show her the heart of the desert she thought she knew.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Rebel of the Sands reveals what happens when a dream deferred explodes—in the fires of rebellion, of romantic passion, and the all-consuming inferno of a girl finally, at long last, embracing her power.</p>

    <p>Hello! I'm Sam and I read past my bedtime. I live on a diet that mostly consists of young adult science fiction and fantasy. Like a lot of readers, I'm working on a handful of stories I want to throw out into the world in hopes that someone will like it.<p>
    <p>Margaret Atwood signed my copy of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38447.The_Handmaid_s_Tale"><em>A Handmaid's Tale</em></a> (picture above) at <a href="http://www.thebookcon.com/">BookCon</a> 2017 and I just about died right then and there. I was obsessed with Sarah J. Maas for a moment, but the craze has died down. My favorite recent YA series is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/62018-the-lunar-chronicles"><em>The Lunar Chronicles</em></a> by Marissa Meyer. My favorite old-school fantasy book is <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/518848.Sabriel?ac=1&from_search=true">Sabriel</a></em>, by Garth Nix (and also the other two books in the series because I love the Disputable Dog). As you can tell, sometimes my best friend and I dress up as literary characters (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLwyn8uQhkw">"Can ya hear the empty spaces?!"</a>).</p>
    <p>When I'm not reading, I'm teaching others how to code, or trying to build things like this website. Python is love. For real. If you like code too, check out my <a href="https://github.com/scausey">github</a>! You can find me other places online too: </p>
